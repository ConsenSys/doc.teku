# Managing memory

Manage Teku's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory requirements by setting a maximum heap size
using the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.

We recommend setting the maximum heap size to 2GB if you have less than 8GB of RAM. This results in
an approximate process size of 3.5GB (on Linux).

Set the heap size using the environment variable, or using the command line when starting Teku.

=== "Environment variable"

    ```bash
    export JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx2g
    ```

=== "Command line"

    ```bash
    JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx2g ./teku [options]
    ```

!!! note

    The node uses of more RAM to perform better if itâ€™s available, especially during periods
    of non-finalization.
