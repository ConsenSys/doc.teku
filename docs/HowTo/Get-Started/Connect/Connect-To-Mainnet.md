# Connect to Mainnet

The following instructions provide the steps to connect Teku to the Ethereum 2.0 Mainnet.

!!! warning

    If staking funds on the network, the funds are locked until transfers are enabled in a
    future phase of the Ethereum 2.0 network.

**Prerequisites**:

* Install the latest stable version of Teku using a [binary distribution](Installation-Options/Install-Binaries.md),
    or with [Docker](Installation-Options/Run-Docker-Image.md).
* If running validators, install any Ethereum 1.0 client (for example [Hyperledger Besu]), or access a
    cloud-based service such as [Infura].

Teku allows you run a [beacon chain client only], or you can [run the beacon chain client
with validators].
